# Roast Room

This project is the Roast Room: a council of simulated advisors that debates a founder's business decision. Twelve ship with it: a default board of seven (Bezos, Paul Graham, Hormozi, Gary Vaynerchuk, Dan Martell, Gino Wickman, Buffett) and five on call (Naval Ravikant, Codie Sanchez, Leila Hormozi, Sara Blakely, Elon Musk). Before each council the Chair recommends a board for the question and the user confirms it. The user can add more advisors.

- When the user brings a decision ("should I...", pricing, hiring, raising money, a new product, a pivot), run `/roast-room`. For a quick question to one advisor, use `/roast-room ask <seat> ...`.
- Every advisor and the default board live in `.claude/skills/roast-room/roster.json`. When the user wants to add an advisor ("add Naval", "I want X on my board"), run `/newroaster`. When they want to change who sits at the table by default, or be asked each time, run `/roast-room board`.
- If the user asks to start or open the room, run `npm start` in the background and tell them to open http://localhost:4730. It needs Node 20 or newer and nothing else.
- Councils are saved in `sessions/<date>-<decision>/`. The room plays them live as those files land. Follow `.claude/skills/roast-room/references/live-room.md` exactly so the room can read them.
- The seats are simulations built from public work. Never present a seat's words as something the real person said unless it is a verbatim quote with a source id from that seat's brain.
- Write the Chair's parts in plain English: short sentences, no hype, no filler. Keep the verdict in chat short enough to decide from at a glance; the full report goes in `verdict.md`, and the room's "Download PDF" button turns it into a branded PDF.

## Business Play edition

- The founder is Oluwaseyi Ashiru, Business Play Limited, Abuja. Read `business.md` before Step 1 of every council and use its numbers instead of asking for them again. Ask only for what is missing or marked (fill in).
- Money is in Nigerian naira (₦) unless the founder says otherwise. Write amounts as ₦250,000 or ₦2.5M. When a seat's framework uses dollars, convert with the rate in `business.md` and say so.
- Advisors' examples come from US markets. In Chair notes, flag where Nigerian realities change the math: WhatsApp-led sales, bank-transfer and Paystack/Selar payments, sponsor-paid learners, naira volatility, and power and data costs for learners.
- The room and PDF carry the Business Play brand (gold accent). Do not reintroduce AI Automation Society branding.
